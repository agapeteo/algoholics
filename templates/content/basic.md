# Basic data structures

### data structures:
- Binary search tree
- Ring buffer
- Graph

### algorithms:

#### graph related

- BFS
- DFS
 
#### sorting
- count how many times each work appears in text using hash map (associative array
- Expression evaluation using Dijkstra's two-stack algorithm 
- two-sum problem
- merge sort
- quick sort
