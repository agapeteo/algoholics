# Basic data structures

### data structures:
- [Binary search tree](/binary-search-tree.html)
- [Graph](/graph.html)
- [Ring buffer](/ring-buffer.html)


### algorithms:

#### Tree related
- lowest common ancestor 
- count how many times each work appears in text using hash map (associative array)
 
 
#### sorting

- Expression evaluation using Dijkstra's two-stack algorithm 
- two-sum problem
- [merge sort](/merge-sort.html)
- [quick sort](/quick-sort.html)
