Ninja data structures and algorithms

### Data structures:

- Balanced Search Tree
- B* tree
- Kd tree
- interval trees


### Graph:

- MST, like Kruskal's
- max flow
- shortest path in graph with negative weights
- A* 
- graph coloring
- sales person travel problem 

### String and text:

- regular expressions
- LZW compression
- substring search: KMP, Rabin-Karp
- suffix array
- text compression

### Dynamic programming:

- rod cutting
- edit distance
- longest common subsequence
- longest increasing sequence


### Other:

- backtracking algorithms, like TSP
- bloom filter
